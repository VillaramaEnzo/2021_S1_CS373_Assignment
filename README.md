# 2021_S1_CS373_Assignment

Forked project skeleton code ~ 
=============================================================

This was my submission for my Image Proccessing Assignment for COMPSCI 373 Semester 1 2020

This required me to use what was studied from class in order to generate a software that detects QR codes in images -  Essentially just draws a box around a QR code in an image to identify that it is there

~ Wanted to implement actual functionality to it, but didnt get time to. 
~ Will revisit and probably start a new version from scratch
